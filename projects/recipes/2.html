		<h2>Why Is It Important To Our Family?</h2>
		<p>Tacos bring us together on Tuesday, even though we barely 
		ever eat them on Tuesday.It's the thought that counts though, 
		I think. I love tacos, I have no idea how to express the joy I 
		have from eating a good taco. Usually I eat my dinner quickly 
		so I have time to finish homework, but when there are tacos, 
		I take my sweet time. Savoring every bite because I really don't 
		want it to end. I tried asking my family for a quote on why 
		tacos are meaningful for our family but all they did was become 
		salespeople trying to sell tacos. Nevertheless my favorite quote 
		was:<q>Tacos, it's what Molly won't complain about.</q></p>
