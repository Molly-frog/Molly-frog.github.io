		<img src="../../images/Nico'sStoveMidium.jpg" alt="NICO'S PASTA">
		<!--We had this for dinner, I took the picture-->

		<h2>Why Is It Important To Our Family?</h2>
		<p>*Nico's Pasta was originally made by Stanley Tucci* We make 
		this dish all the time, and the whole family just really enjoys
		it. We never have left overs when we make it because everyone 
		is have seconds or even thirds. When my sister went to Dublin 
		she made it and said <q>it was just a part of me and it felt 
		like I was giving my flatmates a little piece of myself.</q> 
		We're not Italians so it's not our culutre but it sure does mean
		a lot to us.</p>

		<h2>Here We Go!</h2>
