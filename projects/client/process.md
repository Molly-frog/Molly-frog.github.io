# Client Check In 1(In Person): Thursday, Jan 15

I showed the client the home page(idex.html) and the about us page(abtus.html)

## Feedback:

They enjoyed the color scheme and really liked the home page. They did say that the about me page's image could be better. They stated that it looked out of place and to maybe change it or add something to it. 

## Changes:

We decided to change the heading image on the about me page. We did this by added some popcron around the words so it stayed on theme.
